The script acts as a front end for "team10scanner.py", making it accessible through a simple text-based interface while handling input validation and command construction. 
It is the user interaction layer that collects input parameters and passes them to the actual scanning functionality.

The userinput.py script uses the following Libraries:
"ipaddress", this is used for validating IPv4 addresses entered by the user.
"subprocess", this is used to execute the actual scanning script (team10scanner.py) as a separate process.
"time", this library us used for adding a small delay when starting the scipt for a better user experience.

Functionality breakdown of the userinput.py

The script runs in a main interface loop, which allows it to run continuously until the user types 'exit' in one of the input prompts.
the scripts prompts the user to enter an IPv4 address to scan, the submitted address is validated by the "ipaddress" module. 
should the address prove to be invalid, the spript will provide an  error feedback.

after a valid address has been entered, the program offers four different types of network scans:
SV: Service and version scan, PORT: Port scan, OS: OS detection scan, MAP: Host discovery (ping & SYN)
Includes a help option that displays available scan types.
as OS and SV scan requires a valid port to scan, the scanner will prompt the user to input a single port for OS scan, and if SV scan is selected, 
the user can input a single port or a list of ports separated by a single comma. 
The scanner will accept any port between 1 and 65535. If no valid port is given to the OS scan, the scanner will default to port 80.

the userinput.py does not scan the target, it constructs a command to execute team10scanner.py with appropriate parameters:
the first part of the command is "sudo", this is done to to run the scanner with elevated privileges as the creation of ICMP packets requires root privileges. 
The next part of the command is python3 telling the command line to run the scanner as a python program, next us "team10scanner.py, 
this is to start the actual scanner.next the validated IP address, the scan type and the port number are passed as arguments to the scannerplays the output from the scan

once the scanner has completed it's scan, the user will again be prompted with which scan to conduct, or exit to end the scanner
